## PHP
		
PHP is a scripting language originally designed for producing dynamic web pages. It 
has evolved to include a command line interface capability and can be used in 
standalone graphical applications. While PHP was originally created by Rasmus 
Lerdorf in 1995, the main implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group 
and serves as the de facto standard for PHP as there is no formal specification. PHP is 
free software released under the PHP License, however it is incompatible with the 
GNU General Public License (GPL), due to restrictions on the usage of the term PHP. 
It is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for 
web development and can be embedded into HTML. It generally runs on a web 
server, taking PHP code as its input and creating web pages as output. It can be 
deployed on most web servers and on almost every operating system and platform 
free of charge. PHP is installed on more than 20 million websites and 1 million web 
servers.
